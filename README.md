For now this tool assumes you have extracted the required
contents from the Unity asset files. If not here are the
instructions on how to do that:

* Download the Unity [Asset Bundle Extractor](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?22675-Unity-Assets-Bundle-Extractor)
* Download the type package as well from the same post
* Extract both and place the "classdata.tpk" file next to the "AssetBundleExtractor.exe" file
* Open the "resources.assets" file from "C:\Program Files (x86)\AlbionOnline\game\Albion-Online_Data" or equivalent location
* Search for each of the required assets such as "items"
* Export raw for each of the assets and name them "asset.txt", for example "items.txt"

The required exports are:
* accessrights
* achievements
* agentreferences
* agents
* audio
* buildings
* characters
* clustertexts
* emotes
* expeditionagents
* expeditioncategories
* expeditions
* factions
* gamedata
* hints
* itemroles
* items
* localization
* loot
* missions
* mobs
* resourcedistpresets
* resources
* sockets
* spells
* territorytypes
* tiles
* treasures
* world
